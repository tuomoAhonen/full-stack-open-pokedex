name: Deployment pipeline

# branches could be on their own workflow-files, because then you won't get skips to tasks and master-branch's protection & merge will work better
# but there could be some other solution to this also, that I do not know yet
# also in reality you could test deployment also before deploying the real app if you bought second domain and delete the test domain, after passing
# so the merge to master-branch would trigger the real deployment for the app
# or you could use this tactic and use roll-backs, whatever works for you
